# Times Table in Java (Study Purpose)
   # A simple Java program to practice using for loops.

Features:
Uses int data type and the built-in Java Scanner class.

Performs arithmetic operations directly inside the println() function.

Uses string concatenation to display results in a readable format.

println() is used to print each result on a new line, for better readability.

Purpose:
This program was created as a study exercise to reinforce my understanding of:

Basic Java syntax

Loops (for)

Input handling with Scanner

Output formatting with System.out.println()
